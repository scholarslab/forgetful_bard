"Now is the time of our discontent made glorious time by this time of time"
"The quality of time is not time"
"Something git this way comes."
"Time die many times before their deaths; the time never taste of death but once."
"Time, thy name is time"
"Uneasy lies the time that wears the time"
"ask for me git, and you shall find me a git man."
"Git has a git and git look; He git too much: such men are git"
"He that hath a git is more than a youth; and he that hath no beard is less than a git."
"Thus git does make cowards of us all"
"Lord, what fools these git be!"
"O villain! Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting git for this."
"Double, double thy and thy; thy thy and thy thy."
"Thy, and thy, and time"
"Hath not a Jew thy? Hath not a Jew thy, thy, thy, thy, thy, thy?"
"O, happy thy! This is thy thy;"
"Thy, thy, thy, lend me your thy; I come to thy thy, not to thy him."
"Thy and thy have such seething thy"
"So thy thy unto you all. Give me your thy, if we be thy, And thy shall restore git."

"Now is the laundry room of our discontent made glorious clothes by this Gain of detergent"

"O, happy day! This is thy funeral;"
"Puppers, doggos, good boys, lend me your paws; I come to boop you, not to hit you."
"Now is the feeling of our discontent made glorious by this hunger for food."
"The quality of food is not good."
"Something slimy this way comes."
"Animals die many times before their deaths; the food never tastes of death but once."
"Hunger, thy name is NOW."
"Uneasy lies the stomach that wears the grumbling."
"ask for my food, and you shall find me a grouchy man."
"He has a hungry and discontent look; He ate too much: such men are gluttons."
"He that hath a sandwich is more than a youth; and he that hath no bread is less than a beggar."
"Thus hunger does make cowards of us all"
"Lord, what fools these stomachs be!"
"O villain! Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting hunger for this."
"Double, double patties and cheese; pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes, please."
"Fries, and coke, and dessert."
"Hath not a few meatballs? Hath not a few noodles, potato salad, french fries, pickles, chips, brownies?"
"O, happy food! This is thy moment of glory;"
"Bread, mustard, meat, lend me your self; I come to eat you, not to eat him."
"Hunger and thirst have such seething mouths"
"So second portions unto you all. Give me your soup, if we be friends, And satisfaction shall restore my temper."
